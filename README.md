# BTC Babel: The Library of Private Keys

Inspired by Borges' Library of Babel and the digital version (libraryofbabel.info), this project lets you browse every possible 256-bit private key in a deterministic, navigable structure:

- **Hexagons** (unbounded)
- **Walls** (4 per hexagon)
- **Shelves** (5 per wall)
- **Volumes** (32 per shelf)
- **Pages** (1 key per page)

Each location contains a unique 256-bit private key, covering the entire keyspace.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- React

## Usage
- Browse through hexagons, walls, shelves, volumes, and pages.
- Each page displays a unique private key.

## Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
